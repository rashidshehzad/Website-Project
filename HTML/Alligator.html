    <p style="text-align: center;">Alligators are often confused for crocodiles. There are 2 species of alligators, with one living in China and the other living in America. The name Alligator probably comes from the spanish word of lizard, "el lagarto", given to it by Spanish explorers.
        the difference between crocodiles and alligators is that alligators are smaller and have rounder snouts.</p>
